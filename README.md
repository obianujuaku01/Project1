Project: Web application that demonstrates CRUD functionality

I built a simple CRUD app (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tracking Novels.  I used Bootstrap as the frontend. 
About the web application: In this simple Novel Tracker application, you can: 
I.	Create a new Novel 
II.	See the list of novels. 
III. See information of a specific novel. 
IV.	Update the Information of a novel 
V.	Delete a novel information

Future improvements I would make:
i.	Run unit tests. 
ii.	Build the Docker images. 
iii. Push the Docker images to a registry. 
iv.	Deploy to a Swarm.


Documents attached includes:
1.	Full code for the CRUD application
2.	Screenshot of Jenkins clone
3.	Video of VM
4.	Video of Github and Jenkins
